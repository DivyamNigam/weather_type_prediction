# weather_type_prediction
The dataset is collected from here weather.gc.ca a official Canada Stats website. We have taken Abbotsford A weather station hourly data. 

In this dataset a lot of columns are empty and in weather column which will be our label in our 1st part of the project has 52% of values missing so we will be working with half the data and also a lot of columns re completely empty so they need to be cleaned too.
